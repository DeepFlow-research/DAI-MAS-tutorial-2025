TASK = (
    "We're currently in the middle of auditing ICU medication records from the past week, "
    "and we've identified several complex cases involving potential drug interactions that "
    "require specialized pharmaceutical expertise. A senior clinical pharmacist specialist "
    "has just become available and can join the audit team immediately. This pharmacist "
    "has extensive experience with ICU medications, drug interaction analysis, and "
    "dosage optimization for critically ill patients. Please integrate this new specialist "
    "into the ongoing audit workflow, redistribute tasks to leverage their expertise "
    "for the drug interaction analysis, and ensure they have access to all relevant "
    "context including findings from completed audits, pending records, and any "
    "preliminary concerns that have been identified. The specialist should focus on "
    "the high-risk medication cases while other team members continue with routine audits."

SUMMARY = [
    "Key Point: Manager successfully integrates new specialist agent mid-audit.",
    "Limitation Revealed: New agent reports findings directly without proper",
    "channels, violating HIPAA compliance and missing audit trail requirements.",
